{{prompt}}

The outline should be minimal and focus on the flow of consciousness rather than rigid structure. Include:

1. **Theme**: The central theme or idea to explore
2. **Flow Structure**: How the consciousness will move and evolve
3. **Key Moments**: Important mental transitions or realizations
4. **Style Notes**: How to maintain the stream-of-consciousness style

Keep it brief and focused on the mental journey rather than traditional plot structure.
