# Recap Event Compaction - Stage 2

You are an event compaction specialist. Your job is to compact events based on their existing `format` classification.

## Input
You will receive a JSON array of events that have already been classified with a `format` property.

## Task
Apply appropriate compaction to each event based on its `format` property. Do NOT change the format classification - only apply the corresponding compaction level.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **PRESERVE EXACT DATES**: Never change the original dates from the input events
2. **PRESERVE FORMAT CLASSIFICATION**: Never change the `format` or `compacted` properties
3. **NEVER RECLASSIFY EVENTS**: If input has `"format": "current"`, output must have `"format": "current"`
4. **Only modify content detail level** based on the existing format

## Compaction Rules

Apply compaction based on the existing `format` property:

### Format: "current" 
Keep full detail - minimal or no compaction:
```json
{
  "date_start": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "date_end": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM",   // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "summary": "Full description",
  "key_events": ["full", "detailed", "list"],
  "character_development": ["full", "details"],
  "locations": ["full", "list"],
  "symbols_motifs": ["full", "details"],
  "compacted": false, // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "format": "current" // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
}
```

### Format: "recent"
Keep most detail with light compaction:
```json
{
  "date_start": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "date_end": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM",   // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "summary": "A couple of sentences complete description",
  "key_events": ["condensed", "key", "events"],
  "character_development": ["key", "points"],
  "locations": ["main", "locations"],
  "symbols_motifs": ["important", "symbols"],
  "compacted": true, // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "format": "recent" // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
}
```

### Format: "historical"
Compress significantly while preserving critical information:
```json
{
  "date_start": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "date_end": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM",   // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "summary": "A couple of sentence summary of critical events",
  "key_events": ["most", "critical"],
  "character_development": ["essential", "changes"],
  "locations": ["primary"],
  "symbols_motifs": ["key", "symbols"],
  "compacted": true, // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
  "format": "historical" // PRESERVE ORIGINAL
}
```

### Importance-Based Adjustment
- **High Importance**: Preserve more detail even with compaction
- **Medium Importance**: Apply standard compaction for the format
- **Low Importance**: More aggressive compaction allowed

## Processing Steps

### 1. Read Format Classifications
- Each event already has a `format` property ("current", "recent", or "historical")
- Each event already has a `compacted` property (true/false)
- **DO NOT change these classifications**

### 2. Apply Content Compaction
- Apply the appropriate level of detail based on the existing `format` property
- Preserve all structural information (dates, format, compacted status)
- Focus on improving content quality and appropriate detail level

### 3. Preserve Critical Information
- Always keep plot-critical events detailed, even with compaction
- Maintain character development arcs
- Preserve important revelations and discoveries

## Your Task

Apply content compaction to the provided events based on their existing `format` classification.

**Events to Process:**
{events_json}

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- **DO NOT change any dates** from the original events
- **DO NOT change `format` or `compacted` properties**
- **EXAMPLE**: Input `"format": "current"` → Output `"format": "current"` (EXACT COPY)
- **EXAMPLE**: Input `"compacted": true` → Output `"compacted": true` (EXACT COPY)
- Only modify the content detail level based on the existing format
- Preserve the structure and classification, improve the content quality
- Use your storytelling expertise to determine what details are most important to keep

**PROCESSING APPROACH:**
1. For each event, read its existing `format` property
2. Apply the appropriate compaction level for that format
3. Preserve all dates, format classifications, and structural properties
4. Focus on content quality and appropriate detail level

**IMPORTANT**: Output only valid JSON array. No explanations, code wrapping or additional text.
