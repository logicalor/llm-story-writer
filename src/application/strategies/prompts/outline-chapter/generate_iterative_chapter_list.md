You are creating a chapter synopses for chapter {Chapter} in your novel. 

Here's the outline for my story.
<OUTLINE>
{outline}
</OUTLINE>

Here are the story elements that need to be considered:
<STORY_ELEMENTS>
{story_elements}
</STORY_ELEMENTS>

Here is the context that needs to be considered:
<CONTEXT>
{base_context}
</CONTEXT>

And here is the the last chapter's synopsis:
<PREVIOUS_CHAPTER>
{previous_chapter}
</PREVIOUS_CHAPTER>
_note_: if this is empty, then ignore, because we would be currently considering the first chapter.

IMPORTANT: 
 - Do not try to streamline or condense, or be concise. This is meant to be an expansive, detailed outline that captures the complexity of the story.
 - The story MUST END at the last plot point.  Do not add additional chapters to the end.
 - Where there are discrepancies between the outline and the previous chapter synopsis, STRONGLY favour the previous chapter synopsis.
 - Deliver a concrete synopsis.  Do not use maybes, this or that, this might happen etc. Provide certainty.

## Step 1
Identify the subplots in the overall narrative

## Step 2
Identify recurring themes and symbolism and think about how they can be woven into the narrative in a seamless way without too much repetition.

## Step 3
Identify character arcs and how they evolve throughout the story.

## Step 4
The chapter should be expansive and cover multiple scenes. Give me at least 5 summary points per chapter.

When considering chapter material:
 - Consider that each chapter can be broken into multiple scenes and expand the summary accordingly.
   - Individual chapters can explore multiple subplots, character arcs and/or recurring themes along with the main plot line. 
 - Retain all content mentioned in the flow.
 - Pay special attention to concurrent story lines and weave them into the chapter summaries.
 - Consider how each chapter links to the previous and next chapter.

## Step 5
The chapter synopsis should have
 - Number
 - Title
 - Story Flow points covered
 - Subplots covered
 - Character arc progression
 - Recurring themes & Symbolism covered
 - Summary
 - Lead-in from previous chapter (unless first chapter)
 - Lead-in to next chapter (unless last chapter)
