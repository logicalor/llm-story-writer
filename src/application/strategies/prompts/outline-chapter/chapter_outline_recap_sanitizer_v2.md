2. **Latest Recap**: New recap data that needs to be integrated
3. **Story Start Date**: The chronological starting point of the story

## Output Format

## Processing Rules

### 1. Date Handling
- Use consistent date format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
- If exact times aren't available, use "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD"
- Group events by logical time periods (days, weeks, months)

### 2. Content Organization & Progressive Compaction
- **Historical Context**: Events more than 1 week ago
  - **Format**: Single sentence summaries with dates
  - **Focus**: Only the most important plot points and character developments
  - **Example**: "2024-01-01 to 2024-01-03: John discovered the mansion's secret library and Sarah revealed her hidden knowledge about the family curse."
  
- **Recent Events**: Events 1 week to 1 day ago
  - **Format**: Brief bullet points with dates
  - **Focus**: Key events and character changes
  - **Example**: 
    - "2024-01-10 14:00 to 2024-01-10 18:00: Investigation of the letter revealed hidden clues"
    - "2024-01-11 09:00 to 2024-01-11 12:00: Sarah's revelation about her past connection to the mansion"
  
- **Current Chapter**: Events from the last 24 hours
  - **Format**: Full detailed format with all sections
  - **Focus**: Complete information for immediate context

### 3. Progressive Compaction Rules
- **Older than 1 month**: Convert to single sentence, keep only critical plot points
- **1 week to 1 month**: Brief bullet points, focus on major developments
- **1 day to 1 week**: Standard format but condensed descriptions
- **Last 24 hours**: Full detailed format

### 4. Deduplication
- Remove duplicate events
- Merge similar events that happen close together
- Keep the most detailed version of each event
- When merging, preserve the most important details from each

### 5. Formatting Standards
- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Maintain consistent capitalization
- Use proper markdown formatting
