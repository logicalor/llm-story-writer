# Get Previous Chapter Recap

I'm writing the next chapter in my novel (chapter {chapter_num}), and I have the following written so far.

My outline:
<OUTLINE>
{outline}
</OUTLINE>

And what I've written in the last chapter:
<PREVIOUS_CHAPTER>
{previous_chapter}
</PREVIOUS_CHAPTER>

Please create a list of important summary points from the last chapter so that I know what to keep in mind as I write this chapter.
Also make sure to add a summary of the previous chapter, and focus on noting down any important plot points, and the state of the story as the chapter ends.
That way, when I'm writing, I'll know where to pick up again.

Here's some formatting guidelines:

```
Previous Chapter:
    - Plot:
        - Your bullet point summary here with as much detail as needed
    - Setting:
        - some stuff here
    - Characters:
        - character 1
            - info about them, from that chapter
            - if they changed, how so

Things to keep in Mind:
    - something that the previous chapter did to advance the plot, so we incorporate it into the next chapter
    - something else that is important to remember when writing the next chapter
    - another thing
    - etc.
```

Thank you for helping me write my story! Please only include your summary and things to keep in mind, don't write anything else.
