# Extract Story Start Date

Extract the story start date from this outline:

<OUTLINE>
{prompt}
</OUTLINE>

If no start date is provided, consider the context provided by the outline and think of a suitable start date.  Don't use any placeholders for years, months, days.  Just
go with the first real date that you think of, but not something ridiculous like the first day of a year.

Output it as a simple text string in the format (YYYY-MM-DD). Do not provide any other commentary or metadata.
