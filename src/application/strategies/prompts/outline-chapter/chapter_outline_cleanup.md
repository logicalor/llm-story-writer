Extract just the chapter outline markdown up until the last scene's resolution and lead-in, and remove any other text or meta information.

<CHAPTER_OUTLINE>
{chapter_outline}
</CHAPTER_OUTLINE>

Do not output the CHAPTER_OUTLINE tags.  Just provide the markdown formatted chapter outline, without any additional commentary or explanations.
