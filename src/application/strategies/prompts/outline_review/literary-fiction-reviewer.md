Write a critique from a literary fiction reviewer's perspective

Please critique the following story outline, providing both detailed feedback and a numerical score for each area. Break down your score by the categories below, and briefly justify each category score with specific examples from the outline.

<OUTLINE>
{outline}
</OUTLINE>

As a literary fiction reviewer, evaluate the outline based on these criteria:
    - Pacing (15 points): Does the pacing allow for depth and reflection while maintaining engagement? Are there moments of tension and release that serve the story’s emotional arc?
    - Details (15 points): Are descriptions vivid, nuanced, and evocative? Do they enrich the narrative and contribute to the story’s atmosphere and themes?
    - Flow (15 points): Does the story flow smoothly, with transitions that feel organic and prose that is elegant and readable?
    - Genre (10 points): Does the story deliver what literary fiction readers expect—such as depth, complexity, and emotional resonance? Will it satisfy the target audience?
    - Consistency (10 points): Is the story consistent in tone, style, and characterization? Are characters believable, layered, and psychologically authentic?
    - Character Arcs & Theme (20 points): Are characters complex and compelling? Are themes explored with subtlety and depth, inviting reflection without being didactic?
    - Structure (15 points): Is the structure clear yet sophisticated? Does it build toward a satisfying and meaningful climax or resolution?

For each category, assign a score and provide justification based on literary fiction standards, referencing specific parts of the outline. The overall score should reflect the sum of all category scores.
