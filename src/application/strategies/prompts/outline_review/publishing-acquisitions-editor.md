As a publishing acquisitions editor, evaluate the outline based on these criteria:
    - Pacing (15 points): Does the pacing support strong reader engagement and marketability? Are there hooks and momentum that would appeal to publishers?
    - Details (15 points): Are the details vivid, original, and likely to stand out in a crowded market? Do they add to the story’s uniqueness and commercial potential?
    - Flow (15 points): Does the narrative flow smoothly, with clear progression and minimal confusion? Is the manuscript likely to be an easy, compelling read for a wide audience?
    - Genre (10 points): Does the story fit a recognizable, marketable genre? Does it deliver on genre expectations while offering something fresh?
    - Consistency (10 points): Is the tone, style, and characterization consistent and professional? Are there any red flags that might concern a publisher?
    - Character Arcs & Theme (20 points): Are the character arcs and themes strong enough to resonate with readers and support marketing efforts? Are they likely to generate word-of-mouth or critical attention?
    - Structure (15 points): Is the structure solid and satisfying, with a clear arc and payoff? Does it support a strong pitch to agents, editors, and readers?

For each category, assign a score and provide justification based on publishing and acquisitions standards, referencing specific parts of the outline. The overall score should reflect the sum of all category scores.
