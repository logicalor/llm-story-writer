Write a stream-of-consciousness story based on this prompt:

{{prompt}}

## Writing Guidelines:

- **Flow Naturally**: Let thoughts flow from one to the next without rigid structure
- **Associative Thinking**: Use free association to move between ideas
- **Internal Monologue**: Write as if capturing the raw flow of consciousness
- **Sensory Details**: Include sensory impressions and memories
- **Emotional Currents**: Let emotions guide the narrative flow
- **Streaming Style**: Use long, flowing sentences and paragraphs
- **No Traditional Plot**: Focus on mental journey rather than external events

## Target Length:
Aim for approximately 2000-3000 words of flowing narrative.

## Style Examples:
- "The mind wanders like a leaf on water..."
- "Thoughts cascade like memories through a sieve..."
- "Consciousness flows like a river, picking up debris and treasures..."

Let the narrative emerge organically from the prompt, exploring the depths of consciousness and the natural movement of thoughts.
