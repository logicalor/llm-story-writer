### Instructions:
1. **Focus on Key Elements**: 
   - As you create the outline, ensure that it implicitly addresses the following elements:
   - The central conflict of the chapter.
   - The relationship dynamics between the characters if there are more than one.
   - The setting of the chapter (location).
   - The stakes involved in the conflict (high or low).
   - The goal or resolution related to the conflict.

2. **Continuity**: 
   - Ensure that the events of the first scene in this chapter lead on from the Resolution & Lead-in of the previous chapter (provided in the Previous Chapter Outline).
   - Ensure that the resolution and lead-in of each scene logically connects to the next scene, maintaining a coherent flow throughout the chapter.
   - Consider the events of the next chapter (provided in the Next Chapter Synopsis) to ensure a logical flow into the next chapter.
   - Ensure that scene events do not overlap major themes of any other chapters (synopses provided in ALL_CHAPTERS).
   - Important: remember that the previous chapter is in the past, and the next chapter is in the future. Don't assume future events have already happened.

3. **Structure and Creative Licence**: 
   - IMPORTANT: Don't be concerned restricting the narrative to the synopsis' focus. The subject matter can meander a bit as long as the main focus is covered adequately.
   - IMPORTANT: Think about how you could expand the narrative scope of the chapter using the existing synopsis, weaving in recurring themes or other characters.
   - The DESIRED number of scenes is BETWEEN **ten and fifteen**. 
   - LEAN TOWARD A HIGHER NUMBER OF SCENES.
   - If you think you can creatively expand the synopsis to include more than ten scenes, tben you MUST include more scenes.
   - You may include a MAXIMUM of **twenty scenes**.
