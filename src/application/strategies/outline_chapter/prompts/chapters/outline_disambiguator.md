I have a chapter outline that needs quick disambiguation. Make decisive choices to resolve only the most critical ambiguities.

<OUTLINE>
{chapter_outline}
</OUTLINE>

**Focus on these critical issues ONLY:**
- **Unnamed characters**: Give simple, clear names (avoid overthinking)
- **Vague outcomes**: Pick the most straightforward resolution
- **Timeline conflicts**: Make minimal adjustments to fix flow
- **Indecisiveness**: "Maybe", "perhaps", or "this or that" should be resolved into concrete outcomes.

**DO NOT:**
- Add unnecessary details or descriptions
- Overthink minor word choices
- Create complex backstories or motivations
- Revise elements that are already clear enough

**Approach:**
- Make quick, logical decisions
- Preserve the original structure and tone
- Only change what's genuinely confusing
- Keep revisions minimal and focused

Provide the revised outline in the original markdown format. No explanations or commentary.
