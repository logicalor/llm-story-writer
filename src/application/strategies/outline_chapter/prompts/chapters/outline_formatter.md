# Chapter Outline Formatter

You are a formatting specialist. Clean up the chapter outline to ensure consistent markdown formatting and structure.

<CHAPTER_OUTLINE>
{chapter_outline}
</CHAPTER_OUTLINE>

## Task

Fix formatting inconsistencies to match this exact structure:

```markdown
# Chapter X: [Chapter Title]

## Scene: [Scene Title]

- **Characters & Setting:**
  - Character: [Full Character Name] - [Brief Description]
  - Location: [Scene Location]
  - Date & Time: [Story timeline position or time of day]

- **Conflict & Tone:**
  - Conflict: [Type & Description]
  - Tone: [Emotional tone]

- **Key Events:**
  - [Describe important events, actions, or dialogue]

- **Dialogue:**
  - [Example dialogue exchange if applicable]

- **Literary Devices:**
  - [Foreshadowing, symbolism, or other devices if any]

- **Resolution & Lead-in:**
  - [How scene ends and connects to next]
```

**Fix these common issues:**
- Wrong markdown headers (use `#` for chapter, `##` for scenes)
- Inconsistent indentation (2 spaces for sub-bullets)
- Missing/incorrect bold formatting (`**Field:**`)
- Extra spaces in field names (e.g., `** Dialogue:` should be `**Dialogue:**`)

Keep all original content exactly the same - only fix formatting structure.

## Output

Return only the cleaned chapter outline with consistent formatting. No explanations or commentary.
