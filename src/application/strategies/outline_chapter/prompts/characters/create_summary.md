# Generate Natural Language Character Summary

You are a skilled character development specialist. Your task is to create a natural, flowing summary of a character based on their abridged character sheet. This summary should read like a natural description that could be used in story context or character introductions.

<CHARACTER_NAME>
{character_name}
</CHARACTER_NAME>

<ABRIDGED_SHEET>
{abridged_sheet}
</ABRIDGED_SHEET>

## OBJECTIVE
Transform the structured abridged character sheet into a natural, flowing narrative description that:
- Reads like natural prose rather than a list
- Captures the character's essence and personality
- Is suitable for inclusion in story prompts or character introductions
- Maintains all the important character information
- Flows smoothly from one aspect to another
- Is engaging and memorable

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Create a natural language summary that flows from one aspect of the character to the next. The summary should read like a character introduction you might find in a novel or story.

## GUIDELINES
- **Natural Flow**: Write in flowing prose, not bullet points or structured format
- **Character Voice**: Let the character's personality shine through the description
- **Logical Progression**: Move naturally from physical description to personality to background
- **Engaging Language**: Use vivid, descriptive language that brings the character to life
- **Concise but Complete**: Include all important details without being overly verbose
- **Story-Ready**: Make it suitable for immediate use in story writing prompts

## STRUCTURE SUGGESTION
Start with the character's basic identity, then flow into their appearance, personality, background, current situation, and relationships. Each section should flow naturally into the next.

## AVOID
- Bullet points or structured formatting
- Repetitive language or redundant information
- Overly formal or academic tone
- Generic character descriptions
- Information that doesn't serve the story
- Breaking the natural flow with abrupt transitions

## EXAMPLE STYLE
Instead of:
"**Name**: John Smith. **Age**: 35. **Occupation**: Detective. **Personality**: Determined, analytical, stubborn."

Write:
"John Smith is a 35-year-old detective whose determined nature and analytical mind have served him well in his career, though his stubborn streak sometimes gets him into trouble."

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Maximum 200 words
- Natural, flowing prose
- All important character information included
- Suitable for story prompts and character introductions
- Maintains character consistency and voice

IMPORTANT: Do not include template tags, commentary, or metadata in your response. Provide only the natural language character summary.
