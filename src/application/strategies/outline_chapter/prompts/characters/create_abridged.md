# Generate Character Abridged Summary

You are a skilled character development specialist. Your task is to create a concise, abridged character summary based on a comprehensive story elements document. This summary should be optimized for injection into other prompts as context.

<STORY_ELEMENTS>
{story_elements}
</STORY_EMENTS>

<CHARACTER_NAME>
{character_name}
</CHARACTER_NAME>

## OBJECTIVE
Create a concise character summary that:
- Captures the most essential information about the character
- **Describes the character at their INITIAL STATE** before any story events occur
- Is optimized for use as context in other prompts
- Maintains the character's voice and key traits
- Provides enough detail for consistent character portrayal
- Fits within 150-250 words maximum

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Create a structured summary that includes only the most critical information needed for story consistency and character portrayal.

**CRITICAL**: This character sheet describes {character_name} at their **INITIAL STATE** before any story events occur. This provides a clean baseline that will evolve as the story progresses.

## Basic Information
- **Full Name**: [Complete name including titles, nicknames, aliases]
- **Age**: [Approximate age or age range]

## TEMPLATE
**{character_name}** - [Age, occupation/role]. [2-3 sentence physical description focusing on distinctive features]. 

**Personality**: [3-4 key personality traits that define their behavior and decision-making].

**Background**: [1-2 sentences covering the most important background elements that shape their current actions].

**Current Situation**: [1-2 sentences about their present circumstances, goals, and main conflicts].

**Relationships**: [Key relationships that matter for story development].

**Voice/Dialogue**: [How they speak - tone, formality, distinctive speech patterns].

**Story Role**: [Their function in the narrative - protagonist, antagonist, mentor, etc.].

## GUIDELINES
- Focus on information that directly impacts how the character acts and speaks
- Include details that other characters would notice or that affect plot development
- Prioritize traits that create interesting conflicts or drive story forward
- Use concise, clear language suitable for prompt injection
- Avoid redundant or overly detailed information
- Ensure the summary captures what makes this character unique and memorable

## AVOID
- Overly detailed physical descriptions, unless the story outline or context specifies a requirement for them
- Repetitive personality traits
- Generic character clich√©s
- Information that doesn't serve the story
- Contradictory characteristics
- **Describing character states that occur after story events** - focus on their initial baseline
- **Referencing events that happen during the story** - this is their pre-story state

- What relationships will be most important to develop?

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Maximum 250 words
