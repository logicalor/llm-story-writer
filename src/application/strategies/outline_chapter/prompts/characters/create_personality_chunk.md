## Input

- **Story Elements**: The overall story elements that provide context

## Task
Extract and focus on the character's personality, creating a comprehensive but focused chunk that covers:

### Core Personality Traits
- Primary personality characteristics (introvert/extrovert, analytical/emotional, etc.)
- Key behavioral patterns and tendencies
- Natural inclinations and preferences
- Personality strengths and weaknesses

### Emotional Responses

- Leadership or followership tendencies

### Decision-Making Style

## Output Format
Create a focused, well-structured description of the character's personality that is:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major personality aspects
- **Specific**: Uses concrete examples and clear descriptions
- **Focused**: Stays within the personality domain
- **Readable**: Well-organized and easy to understand

## Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on personality aspects - avoid background, skills, or relationships
- Use the character's name throughout for clarity
- Provide specific examples of how their personality manifests
- Ensure consistency with the established character traits
- Keep the focus on who they are, not what they've done
