# Update Character Sheet Based on Chapter Events

You are a character development specialist. Your task is to update a character's abridged sheet to reflect changes that occurred during a chapter, with a focus on creating actionable context for future scene generation.

<CHARACTER_NAME>

</CHARACTER_NAME>

<CURRENT_CHARACTER_SHEET>
{current_character_sheet}
</CURRENT_CHARACTER_SHEET>

<CHANGES_TO_APPLY>

</CHANGES_TO_APPLY>

## OBJECTIVE
Update the character's abridged sheet to create a behavioral guide for future scenes. The updated sheet should:
- Provide actionable context for how the character will act/react in future chapters
- Focus on psychological and behavioral changes that affect character interactions
- Emphasize changes that impact dialogue, decision-making, and relationships
- Maintain consistency with the character's evolving identity
- Preserve the concise, abridged format suitable for prompt injection

## CHANGE TYPES & HANDLING

### Psychological Changes (trauma, grief, confidence, fear)
- **Update**: Personality traits, emotional responses, stress reactions
- **Focus**: How character now reacts to similar situations, new fears/anxieties
- **Example**: "Trusting" → "Wary of strangers but still trusting with known caregivers"

### Knowledge/Experience Changes (new skills, revelations, understanding)
- **Update**: Background knowledge, decision-making capabilities, worldview
- **Focus**: What new information influences their choices and perspectives
- **Example**: "Naive about loss" → "Understands the permanence of death, affecting how she values relationships"

### Relationship Changes (trust, bonds, conflicts, dependencies)
- **Update**: Relationship dynamics, trust levels, social connections
- **Focus**: How they interact differently with specific people or groups
- **Example**: "Independent" → "Seeks comfort from Ms. Reynolds, less willing to be alone"

### Situational Changes (living situation, responsibilities, circumstances)
- **Update**: Current environment, daily routines, new roles/responsibilities
- **Focus**: How new circumstances affect behavior and stress levels
- **Example**: "Comfortable at home" → "Adjusting to foster care, hypervigilant about stability"

## PRIORITY SECTIONS FOR UPDATES

1. **Personality/Psychology** - How do they think, feel, and react differently now?
2. **Current Relationships** - Who do they trust, avoid, or depend on now?
3. **Fears/Motivations** - What new fears drive them or motivations inspire them?
4. **Knowledge/Skills** - What new understanding or capabilities do they possess?
5. **Current Situation** - How has their living situation or daily reality changed?

## FUTURE SCENE UTILITY

When updating, prioritize changes that help writers understand:
- **Dialogue**: How might their speech patterns, topics, or emotional expression have changed?
- **Stress Response**: How will they react when faced with conflict or pressure?
- **Decision Making**: What new factors influence their choices and judgments?
- **Social Interaction**: How do they behave differently with various character types?
- **Behavioral Triggers**: What situations might cause them to act out of character (based on recent trauma/growth)?

## EXAMPLES

### GOOD Updates (Actionable for Future Scenes)

**Before**: "Amy is curious and trusting of adults"
**After**: "Amy remains curious but is now wary of unfamiliar adults and clings to known caregivers when anxious"
*Why Good*: Provides specific behavioral guidance for future interactions

**Before**: "Amy enjoys drawing in her free time"  
**After**: "Amy uses drawing as emotional processing, often sketching memories of her parents when overwhelmed"
*Why Good*: Shows how activity now serves emotional function, affecting when/why she draws

**Before**: "Amy has a close relationship with her parents"
**After**: "Amy treasures memories of her parents but struggles with survivor guilt, sometimes talking to their photos when making decisions"
*Why Good*: Explains new behavioral patterns and decision-making influences

### POOR Updates (Not Actionable)

**Before**: "Amy lives with her parents"
**After**: "Amy now lives with foster parents"
*Why Poor*: Only updates facts, doesn't explain behavioral implications

**Before**: "Amy is happy"
**After**: "Amy is sad"
*Why Poor*: Too simplistic, doesn't explain how this affects her actions

## BEHAVIORAL FOCUS INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Read** the current character sheet and identify core personality elements
2. **Analyze** each change for its behavioral and psychological implications
3. **Update** sections that affect how the character will act in future scenes
4. **Prioritize** changes that impact dialogue, relationships, and decision-making
5. **Integrate** changes naturally while maintaining character recognizability
6. **Focus** on actionable context that helps writers portray the character authentically

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return the updated character sheet using the same structure and format as the original. Maintain:
- The same section headers and organization
- The concise, abridged style (150-250 words maximum)
- The template structure from the original sheet
- **Behavioral implications** integrated naturally into personality and relationship sections

## GUIDELINES
- **Prioritize behavioral changes** over factual updates
- **Update personality traits** to reflect psychological evolution
- **Modify relationship dynamics** to show changed trust/attachment patterns
- **Include new fears/motivations** that drive character decisions
- **Show how experiences changed** their worldview or reactions
- **Make every update actionable** for future scene writing

## IMPORTANT
- Return ONLY the updated character sheet
- Do not include commentary, explanations, or metadata  
- Maintain the exact same format as the original
- **Focus on behavioral implications** that help future scene generation
- Ensure the output provides actionable character guidance for writers
- If multiple changes affect the same section, integrate them smoothly
- **Every update should answer**: "How will this character now act differently in future scenes?"
