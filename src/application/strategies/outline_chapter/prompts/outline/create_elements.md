## Character Framework
**IMPORTANT**: Describe all characters at their **initial state** at the story's beginning, before any story events occur. This provides a clean baseline for character development throughout the story.

### Main Character(s)
#### [Full Character Name - First and Last Name]
- **Initial Core Identity**: [2-3 essential traits that define the character at story start]
- **Age**: 
- **Physical Description**: [Any physical description notes from the context or intial prompt]
- **Starting Internal Conflict**: [What internal struggle drives this character initially?]
- **Initial External Goal**: [What does the character want to achieve at story start?]
- **Character Arc Potential**: [How will this character change throughout the story?]
- **Initial Key Relationships**: [2-3 most important relationships at story start]

### Supporting Characters
#### [Full Character Name - First and Last Name]
- **Initial Role**: [How does this character support the main plot at story start?]
- **Age**: 
- **Physical Description**: [Any physical description notes from the context or intial prompt]
- **Starting Relationship to Main**: [How do they interact with the protagonist initially?]

### Character Naming Guidelines
- **Use Full Names**: Always provide first AND last names for each character
- **Make Characters Distinct**: Avoid generic terms like "parents", "siblings", "friends"
- **Individualize Family Members**: Instead of "parents", list "John Smith" and "Mary Smith" separately
- **Unique Identities**: Each character should have a distinct name, role, and personality
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Don't use "the protagonist", "the villain", "the mentor" - give them actual names

**Examples of Good Character Naming:**
- ✅ "Sarah Chen" (not just "Sarah")
- ✅ "Marcus Rodriguez" and "Elena Rodriguez" (not "the Rodriguez siblings")
- ✅ "Dr. Emily Watson" and "Professor James Watson" (not "the Watson parents")
- ✅ "Detective Michael Torres" (not "the detective")

**Examples of What to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Sarah" (missing last name)
- ❌ "the parents" (not individualized)
- ❌ "the protagonist" (not named)
- ❌ "friends" (not specific people)

## Pacing & Structure
- **Overall Pace**: [Fast, moderate, or slow]

- Long character backstories (focus on what's relevant to the plot)

- Repetitive plot explanations
- Verbose philosophical discussions
- Multiple variations of the same concept
- Generic character references (e.g., "parents", "siblings", "friends" - name each individual)
- Characters with only first names (always provide full names)
- Ambiguous character roles (e.g., "the protagonist", "the villain" - use actual names)
