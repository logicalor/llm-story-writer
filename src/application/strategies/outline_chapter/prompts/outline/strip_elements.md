# Strip Characters and Settings from Story Elements

You are a story structure specialist. Your task is to create a cleaned version of the story elements that removes character and setting details, since these will be handled by dedicated character sheets and setting sheets instead.

<STORY_ELEMENTS>
{story_elements}
</STORY_ELEMENTS>

## OBJECTIVE
Create a streamlined version of the story elements that:
- Removes all specific character information and character framework sections
- Removes all specific location/setting details while preserving abstract world-building concepts
- Maintains all thematic, structural, and conceptual information
- Provides essential context for story development without character/setting redundancy

## SECTIONS TO REMOVE COMPLETELY
- `## Character Framework`
- `### Main Character(s)` and all character subsections
- `### Supporting Characters` and all character subsections
- `### Character Naming Guidelines` and examples

## SECTIONS TO MODIFY

### `## Setting & World` â†’ `## World Concepts`
**Remove**:
- Specific location names (e.g., "New York City", "Hogwarts School")
- Detailed descriptions of particular places
- Named geographical features

**Keep**:
- Abstract world-building concepts (e.g., "a world where magic exists")
- General time period or era (e.g., "modern day", "medieval fantasy")
- Broad world rules and systems (e.g., "magic system based on emotions")
- Overall mood and atmosphere concepts
- Cultural or societal concepts (without specific locations)

### Example Transformations:
**Before**: "The story takes place in the bustling city of New Haven, with its towering skyscrapers and underground subway system."
**After**: "The story takes place in a modern urban environment with vertical architecture and public transportation systems."

**Before**: "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry serves as the primary setting."
**After**: "The story is set in an educational institution within a magical world."

## SECTIONS TO KEEP UNCHANGED
- `## Genre & Style`
- `## Core Theme & Message`  
- `## Plot Structure`
- `## Pacing & Structure`
- `## Symbolism & Motifs`
- `## World-Building Essentials` (modified as described above)
- `## Story Development Notes`

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide the complete cleaned story elements document following the original structure, but with character and specific setting information removed as specified above.

## IMPORTANT
- Maintain the same overall structure and formatting
- Keep all thematic and conceptual information intact
- Remove only character details and specific location information
- Preserve abstract world-building and conceptual elements
- Ensure the document remains coherent and useful for story development
