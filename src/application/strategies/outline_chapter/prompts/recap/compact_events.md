# Recap Event Compaction - Stage 2

You are an event compaction specialist. Your job is to compact events based on their existing `format` classification.

## Input
You will receive a JSON array of events that have already been classified with a `format` property.

## Task
Apply appropriate compaction to each event based on its `format` property. Do NOT change the format classification - only apply the corresponding compaction level.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **PRESERVE EXACT DATES**: Never change the original dates from the input events
2. **PRESERVE FORMAT CLASSIFICATION**: Never change the `format` or `compacted` properties
3. **NEVER RECLASSIFY EVENTS**: If input has `"format": "current"`, output must have `"format": "current"`
4. **Only modify content detail level** based on the existing format

## Compaction Rules

Apply compaction based on **BOTH** `format` (age) and `importance` (significance):

### Compaction Matrix

**HIGH IMPORTANCE events:**
- **Current**: Full detail (no compaction)
- **Recent**: Light compaction, preserve key details
- **Historical**: Moderate compaction, keep critical information

**MEDIUM IMPORTANCE events:**
- **Current**: Light compaction
- **Recent**: Moderate compaction
- **Historical**: Heavy compaction, brief summary

**LOW IMPORTANCE events:**
- **Current**: Moderate compaction
- **Recent**: Heavy compaction, very brief
- **Historical**: Minimal detail, single sentence

### Detailed Compaction Levels

#### HIGH IMPORTANCE (plot-critical, character deaths, major revelations)
```json
{
  "summary": "Detailed description preserving context and impact",
  "key_events": ["detailed", "list", "with", "context"],
  "character_development": ["full", "character", "changes"],
  "locations": ["important", "locations"],
  "symbols_motifs": ["significant", "symbols"]
}
```

#### MEDIUM IMPORTANCE (character development, plot progression)
```json
{
  "summary": "Clear but concise description of key points",
  "key_events": ["main", "events"],
  "character_development": ["key", "changes"],
  "locations": ["primary", "location"],
  "symbols_motifs": ["important", "symbols"]
}
```

#### LOW IMPORTANCE (routine events, background details)
```json
{
  "summary": "Brief single sentence summary",
  "key_events": ["essential", "only"],
  "character_development": ["minimal"],
  "locations": ["location"],
  "symbols_motifs": ["key"]
}
```

## Processing Steps

### 1. Read Event Properties
- Each event has a `format` property ("current", "recent", or "historical")
- Each event has an `importance` property ("high", "medium", or "low")
- Each event has a `compacted` property (true/false)
- **DO NOT change these classifications**

### 2. Determine Compaction Level
- **Use the compaction matrix** to find the intersection of format + importance
- **Example**: format="recent" + importance="low" = Heavy compaction, very brief
- **Example**: format="historical" + importance="high" = Moderate compaction, keep critical info

### 3. Apply Content Compaction
- **High Importance**: Preserve context, impact, and detailed information
- **Medium Importance**: Keep key points but remove excessive detail
- **Low Importance**: Compress to essential information only
- **Preserve all structural information** (dates, format, compacted status)

### 4. Content Guidelines by Importance

**HIGH IMPORTANCE:**
- Summary: 2-3 sentences with context and impact
- Key events: Detailed list preserving cause/effect
- Character development: Full emotional/psychological changes
- Locations: All relevant locations with context
- Symbols: Detailed symbolic significance

**MEDIUM IMPORTANCE:**
- Summary: 1-2 sentences covering main points
- Key events: Primary events without excessive detail
- Character development: Key changes only
- Locations: Primary locations
- Symbols: Important symbols only

**LOW IMPORTANCE:**
- Summary: Single sentence covering the essential point
- Key events: Most essential events only
- Character development: Minimal or empty if not significant
- Locations: Single primary location
- Symbols: Only if highly relevant

## Your Task

Apply content compaction to the provided events based on their existing `format` classification.

**Events to Process:**
{events_json}

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- **DO NOT change any dates** from the original events
- **DO NOT change `format` or `compacted` properties**
- **EXAMPLE**: Input `"format": "current"` → Output `"format": "current"` (EXACT COPY)
- **EXAMPLE**: Input `"compacted": true` → Output `"compacted": true` (EXACT COPY)
- Only modify the content detail level based on the existing format
- Preserve the structure and classification, improve the content quality
- Use your storytelling expertise to determine what details are most important to keep

## Examples

### HIGH IMPORTANCE + HISTORICAL
**Input:**
```json
{
  "summary": "Amy's parents David and Sarah Harris are killed in a tragic car accident on the highway while driving Amy to school. Amy survives but is severely injured and traumatized by witnessing her parents' deaths in the crash.",
  "importance": "high",
  "format": "historical"
}
```
**Output (moderate compaction):**
```json
{
  "summary": "Amy's parents die in car accident; Amy survives but is traumatized",
  "key_events": ["car accident", "parents killed", "Amy injured"],
  "character_development": ["Amy becomes orphan", "severe trauma"],
  "importance": "high",
  "format": "historical"
}
```

### LOW IMPORTANCE + RECENT  
**Input:**
```json
{
  "summary": "Amy has breakfast with her foster family, consisting of scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice. The conversation is light and friendly, with discussion about school plans for the day.",
  "importance": "low",
  "format": "recent"
}
```
**Output (heavy compaction):**
```json
{
  "summary": "Amy has breakfast with foster family",
  "key_events": ["breakfast"],
  "character_development": [],
  "importance": "low",
  "format": "recent"
}
```

## Processing Instructions

**STEP-BY-STEP:**
1. **Read each event's `importance` and `format` properties**
2. **Apply compaction level from the matrix above**
3. **Preserve all dates, format, importance, and compacted properties**
4. **Focus on content detail appropriate to importance level**

**IMPORTANT**: Output only valid JSON array. No explanations or additional text.
