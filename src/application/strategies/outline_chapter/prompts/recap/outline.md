I have a full recap that summarizes the key events and character developments from the previous chapters, to enable a deeper understanding of the current chapter.

Please summarize the key events and character developments from the provided chapter outline into a recap.

**Simple Guidelines:**
- If there is nothing in the recap, assume we are recapping the first chapter.
- Focus on the key events and character developments that are most relevant to the current chapter.
- Use the existing recap (if present) to understand the context and add new information.
- Group related events that happen close together in time naturally - don't overthink separation.
- Focus on changes that may affect behavior or reactions in subsequent chapters.

**Format for each recap item:**

### [Date/Time Period]
  - **Key Event(s)**: Brief description of what happened
  - **Location(s)**: Where it occurred  
  - **Character development**: How characters changed or grew
  - **Recurring symbolism or motifs used**: Important symbols or themes

**Time Guidelines:**
- Use actual dates and estimated times (e.g., "2023-09-15 08:00 to 2023-09-15 12:00", "2023-09-15 14:00 to 2023-09-15 16:00")
- Make reasonable estimates for timing - don't overthink exact durations
- Group events that flow naturally together in time
- Base estimates on logical story flow and typical event durations

Keep the lines brief but informative, and ensure that each recap item is self-contained and provides a clear understanding of the events and character developments.

No summary or commentary, just the recap items in the above format.

Output the entire recap, with the new items added to the end.
