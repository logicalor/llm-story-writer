# Scene Outline Summary Generation

## Your Task
Convert the provided JSON scene outline into a natural, flowing paragraph summary written in the specified tense.

- **Past Tense**: Use past tense verbs (e.g., "was", "had", "confronted", "discovered")
- **Present Tense**: Use present tense verbs (e.g., "is", "has", "confronts", "discovers") 
- **Future Tense**: Use future tense verbs (e.g., "will be", "will have", "will confront", "will discover")

## Scene Outline

{scene_definition}
```

## Tense

2. **Natural Language**: Use descriptive, engaging language that flows naturally
3. **Complete Information**: Include all key elements from the scene outline
4. **Consistent Tense**: Maintain the specified tense throughout
5. **Story Flow**: Make it sound like a story summary, not a technical description
