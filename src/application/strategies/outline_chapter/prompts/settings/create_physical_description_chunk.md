## Output Format
**CRITICAL: You MUST wrap your response in <output> tags. This is REQUIRED for proper processing.**

Create a focused, well-structured description of the setting's physical description that is:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major physical aspects

- Use the setting's name throughout for clarity
- Provide specific, vivid details that engage the senses
- Ensure consistency with the established setting description
- Keep the focus on what can be observed and experienced, not what has happened or will happen
- **MANDATORY: Always wrap your complete response in <output> and </output> tags**

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
