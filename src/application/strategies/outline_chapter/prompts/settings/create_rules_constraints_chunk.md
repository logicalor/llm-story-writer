# Setting Rules and Constraints Chunk Generation

You are tasked with extracting and focusing on the rules, constraints, and limitations of a setting from its full setting sheet. Create a focused, detailed description of the setting's boundaries, restrictions, and governing principles.

## Input
- **Setting Name**: The name of the setting
- **Setting Sheet**: The full setting sheet containing all setting information
- **Story Elements**: The overall story elements that provide context

## Task
Extract and focus on the setting's rules and constraints, creating a comprehensive but focused chunk that covers:

### Physical Constraints
- Physical boundaries and limitations
- Access restrictions and barriers
- Size and capacity limitations
- Environmental constraints and hazards
- Structural limitations and requirements

### Social and Cultural Rules
- Behavioral expectations and norms
- Social hierarchies and power structures
- Cultural taboos and restrictions
- Communication rules and protocols
- Dress codes and appearance standards

### Legal and Political Constraints
- Laws and regulations that apply
- Authority figures and enforcement
- Permissions and restrictions
- Consequences for rule violations
- Political influence and control

### Economic and Resource Constraints
- Cost and resource limitations
- Availability of goods and services
- Economic restrictions and barriers
- Resource allocation and distribution
- Financial constraints and requirements

### Temporal and Access Constraints
- Time-based restrictions and schedules
- Seasonal or periodic limitations
- Access hours and availability
- Booking and reservation requirements
- Temporal rules and patterns

### Safety and Security Constraints
- Safety regulations and requirements
- Security measures and restrictions
- Risk factors and danger zones
- Emergency procedures and protocols
- Protective measures and limitations

## Output Format
Create a focused, well-structured description of the setting's rules and constraints that is:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major constraint aspects
- **Clear**: Makes limitations and rules obvious
- **Focused**: Stays within the constraints domain
- **Readable**: Well-organized and easy to understand
- **Practical**: Shows what is and isn't allowed

## Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on rules and constraints - avoid physical description or atmosphere
- Use the setting's name throughout for clarity
- Provide specific examples of limitations and restrictions
- Ensure consistency with the established setting rules
- Keep the focus on what constrains or limits the setting, not what it enables

## Example Structure
```
[Setting Name]'s Rules and Constraints

Physical Limitations:
- [Boundaries and access restrictions]
- [Size and capacity constraints]

Social Rules:
- [Behavioral expectations and norms]
- [Cultural restrictions and taboos]

Legal Constraints:
- [Laws and regulations]
- [Authority and enforcement]

Economic Limitations:
- [Cost and resource constraints]
- [Availability restrictions]

Access Constraints:
- [Time and scheduling limitations]
- [Booking and reservation requirements]

Safety Requirements:
- [Safety regulations and protocols]
- [Risk factors and restrictions]
```

Remember: This chunk should be focused specifically on rules and constraints, providing a clear understanding of what limits and governs this setting.
