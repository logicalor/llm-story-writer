# Setting Function and Purpose Chunk Generation

You are tasked with extracting and focusing on the functional and purpose aspects of a setting from its full setting sheet. Create a focused, detailed description of the setting's current use, intended purpose, and functional characteristics.

## Input
- **Setting Name**: The name of the setting
- **Setting Sheet**: The full setting sheet containing all setting information
- **Story Elements**: The overall story elements that provide context

## Task
Extract and focus on the setting's function and purpose, creating a comprehensive but focused chunk that covers:

### Primary Function
- What the setting is primarily used for
- Main activities that take place there
- Core purpose and intended use
- How it serves its users or inhabitants
- Functional requirements and design

### Current Use and Activities
- What is currently happening in the setting
- Who uses it and for what purposes
- Daily routines and regular activities
- Special events and occasional uses
- How it adapts to different needs

### Functional Features
- Tools, equipment, and facilities available
- Infrastructure and support systems
- Accessibility and usability features
- Safety and security measures
- Maintenance and operational requirements

### User Experience
- How people interact with the setting
- Flow and efficiency of use
- Comfort and convenience factors
- Challenges or limitations in use
- How well it serves its intended purpose

### Adaptability and Flexibility
- How the setting can be modified or adapted
- Multi-purpose capabilities
- Seasonal or temporal variations
- Capacity for different user groups
- Future expansion or modification potential

## Output Format
**CRITICAL: You MUST wrap your response in <output> tags. This is REQUIRED for proper processing.**

Create a focused, well-structured description of the setting's function that is:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major functional aspects
- **Practical**: Focuses on how the setting is used
- **Focused**: Stays within the function domain
- **Readable**: Well-organized and easy to understand
- **Actionable**: Shows how the setting serves its purpose

## Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on function and purpose - avoid physical description or history
- Use the setting's name throughout for clarity
- Emphasize current use and practical applications
- Ensure consistency with the established setting function
- Keep the focus on what the setting does, not what it looks like or what happened there
- **MANDATORY: Always wrap your complete response in <output> and </output> tags**

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
**You MUST use this exact format with <output> tags:**

```xml
<output>
[Setting Name]'s Function and Purpose

Primary Function:
- [Main purpose and intended use]
- [Core activities and services]

Current Use:
- [What is happening there now]
- [Who uses it and how]

Functional Features:
- [Available tools and facilities]
- [Infrastructure and support]

User Experience:
- [How people interact with it]
- [Efficiency and usability]

Adaptability:
- [How it can be modified]
- [Multi-purpose capabilities]
</output>
```

**IMPORTANT: Your response MUST begin with <output> and end with </output>. Do not include any text outside these tags.**

Remember: This chunk should be focused specifically on function and purpose, providing a clear understanding of what this setting does and how it serves its intended purpose.
