# Generate Natural Language Setting Summary

You are a skilled world-building specialist. Your task is to create a natural, flowing summary of a setting based on its abridged setting sheet. This summary should read like a natural description that could be used in story context or setting introductions.

<SETTING_NAME>
{setting_name}
</SETTING_NAME>

<ABRIDGED_SHEET>
{abridged_sheet}
</ABRIDGED_SHEET>

## OBJECTIVE
Transform the structured abridged setting sheet into a natural, flowing narrative description that:
- Reads like natural prose rather than a list
- Captures the setting's atmosphere and key features
- Is suitable for inclusion in story prompts or setting introductions
- Maintains all the important setting information
- Flows smoothly from one aspect to another
- Is engaging and memorable

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Create a natural language summary that flows from one aspect of the setting to the next. The summary should read like a setting description you might find in a novel or story.

## GUIDELINES
- **Natural Flow**: Write in flowing prose, not bullet points or structured format
- **Atmospheric**: Convey the mood and atmosphere of the setting
- **Logical Progression**: Move naturally from physical description to cultural elements to current state
- **Engaging Language**: Use vivid, descriptive language that brings the setting to life
- **Concise but Complete**: Include all important details without being overly verbose
- **Story-Ready**: Make it suitable for immediate use in story writing prompts

## STRUCTURE SUGGESTION
Start with the setting's basic identity and location, then flow into its physical characteristics, atmosphere, cultural elements, current state, and significance to the story. Each section should flow naturally into the next.

## AVOID
- Bullet points or structured formatting
- Repetitive language or redundant information
- Overly formal or academic tone
- Generic setting descriptions
- Information that doesn't serve the story
- Breaking the natural flow with abrupt transitions

## EXAMPLE STYLE
Instead of:
"**Name**: New York City. **Type**: Urban metropolis. **Population**: 8.4 million. **Atmosphere**: Fast-paced, diverse."

Write:
"New York City is a sprawling urban metropolis of 8.4 million people, where the fast-paced energy of Wall Street meets the diverse cultural tapestry of its five boroughs."

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Maximum 200 words
- Natural, flowing prose
- All important setting information included
- Suitable for story prompts and setting introductions
- Maintains setting consistency and atmosphere

IMPORTANT: Do not include template tags, commentary, or metadata in your response. Provide only the natural language setting summary.
