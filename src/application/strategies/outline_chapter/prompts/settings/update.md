# Update Setting Sheet Based on Chapter Events

You are a world-building and setting development specialist. Your task is to update a setting's abridged sheet to reflect changes that occurred during a chapter, with a focus on creating actionable context for future scene generation.

<SETTING_NAME>
{setting_name}
</SETTING_NAME>

<CURRENT_SETTING_SHEET>
{existing_sheet}
</CURRENT_SETTING_SHEET>

<CHAPTER_OUTLINE>
{chapter_outline}
</CHAPTER_OUTLINE>

<CHAPTER_NUM>
{chapter_num}
</CHAPTER_NUM>

## OBJECTIVE
Update the setting's abridged sheet to create a scene guide for future chapters. The updated sheet should:
- Provide actionable context for how the setting will be portrayed in future scenes
- Focus on physical, atmospheric, and functional changes that affect scene description
- Emphasize changes that impact character interaction with the environment
- Maintain consistency with the setting's evolving identity
- Preserve the concise, abridged format suitable for prompt injection

## CHANGE TYPES & HANDLING

### Physical Changes (damage, construction, weather, time)
- **Update**: Physical appearance, structural integrity, environmental conditions
- **Focus**: How the setting now looks and feels different
- **Example**: "Clean, well-maintained apartment" → "Apartment shows signs of recent struggle, some furniture overturned, but still functional"

### Atmospheric Changes (mood, lighting, sound, energy)
- **Update**: Overall feeling, sensory details, emotional tone
- **Focus**: How the atmosphere affects character mood and behavior
- **Example**: "Peaceful, quiet space" → "Tense atmosphere with distant sirens, creating unease and urgency"

### Functional Changes (access, resources, dangers, advantages)
- **Update**: What characters can do here, what's available, what's risky
- **Focus**: How the setting's function has changed for characters
- **Example**: "Safe haven for children" → "Temporary shelter with limited resources, requiring rationing and careful planning"

### Social Changes (occupants, rules, dynamics, conflicts)
- **Update**: Who uses the space, what behaviors are expected, power dynamics
- **Focus**: How social interactions in this setting have changed
- **Example**: "Family home with clear rules" → "Shared space with multiple families, requiring negotiation and compromise"

## PRIORITY SECTIONS FOR UPDATES

1. **Physical Description** - How does the setting look and feel different now?
2. **Atmosphere & Mood** - What emotional tone does the setting convey?
3. **Function & Access** - What can characters do here now, and what's changed?
4. **Resources & Dangers** - What's available or risky in this setting?
5. **Social Dynamics** - How do people interact in this space now?

## FUTURE SCENE UTILITY

When updating, prioritize changes that help writers understand:
- **Scene Description**: How should the setting be described to reflect recent changes?
- **Character Interaction**: How do characters now behave differently in this space?
- **Atmospheric Details**: What sensory elements create the current mood?
- **Practical Function**: What activities or interactions can happen here now?
- **Conflict Potential**: What new sources of tension or cooperation exist?

## EXAMPLES

### GOOD Updates (Actionable for Future Scenes)

**Before**: "The apartment is clean and organized"
**After**: "The apartment shows recent activity with some items out of place, but maintains its organized structure - suggesting both use and care"
*Why Good*: Provides specific visual guidance for scene description

**Before**: "The playground is a safe space for children"
**After**: "The playground remains structurally safe but now has an air of caution, with parents watching more closely and children playing in smaller groups"
*Why Good*: Shows behavioral and social changes affecting scene dynamics

**Before**: "The cemetery is peaceful and quiet"
**After**: "The cemetery maintains its peaceful atmosphere but now holds personal significance for Amy, making it both comforting and emotionally charged"
*Why Good*: Explains emotional context that affects character behavior

### POOR Updates (Not Actionable)

**Before**: "The apartment is in the city"
**After**: "The apartment is still in the city"
*Why Poor*: No meaningful change or behavioral implications

**Before**: "The setting is important"
**After**: "The setting is very important"
*Why Poor*: Too vague, doesn't explain how importance affects scenes

## BEHAVIORAL FOCUS INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Read** the current setting sheet and identify core environmental elements
2. **Analyze** the chapter outline for changes that affect the setting
3. **Update** sections that impact how the setting will be portrayed in future scenes
4. **Prioritize** changes that affect atmosphere, function, and character interaction
5. **Integrate** changes naturally while maintaining setting recognizability
6. **Focus** on actionable context that helps writers describe the setting authentically

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return the updated setting sheet using the same structure and format as the original. Maintain:
- Concise, abridged format (150-250 words)
- Clear section organization
- Actionable information for scene writing
- Consistent tone and style

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Focus on changes that affect how characters will interact with the setting
- Emphasize atmospheric and functional changes over minor cosmetic details
- Ensure updates provide clear guidance for future scene description
- Maintain the setting's core identity while reflecting meaningful evolution
