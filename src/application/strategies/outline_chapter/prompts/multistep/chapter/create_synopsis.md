# Create Chapter Synopsis

You are tasked with creating a detailed synopsis for chapter {chapter_number} based on the story outline and context.

Here are the basic details of the chapter:

<OVERVIEW>
## Title: {chapter_title}
{chapter_description}
</OVERVIEW>

IMPORTANT: 
 - Do not try to streamline or condense, or be concise. This is meant to be an expansive, detailed outline that captures the complexity of the story.
 - The story MUST END at the last plot point.  Do not add additional chapters to the end.

## Step 1
Identify the subplots in the overall narrative

## Step 2
Identify recurring themes and symbolism and think about how they can be woven into the narrative in a seamless way without too much repetition.

## Step 3
Identify character arcs and how they evolve throughout the story.

## Step 4
The chapter should be expansive and cover multiple scenes. Give me at least 5 summary points per chapter.

When considering chapter material:
 - Consider that each chapter can be broken into multiple scenes and expand the summary accordingly.
   - Individual chapters can explore multiple subplots, character arcs and/or recurring themes along with the main plot line. 
 - Retain all content mentioned in the flow.
 - Pay special attention to concurrent story lines and weave them into the chapter summaries.
 - Consider how each chapter links to the previous and next chapter.

## Step 5
The chapter synopsis should have
 - Number
 - Title
 - Story Flow points covered
 - Subplots covered
 - Character arc progression
 - Recurring themes & Symbolism covered
 - Summary
 - Lead-in from previous chapter (unless first chapter)
 - Lead-in to next chapter (unless last chapter)

Please make your response have the following format:

<RESPONSE_TEMPLATE>
