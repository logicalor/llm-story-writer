# Create Middle Scene Content

You are now writing a middle scene in a chapter, with rich contextual understanding from the previous steps.

## Context Integration
You have already analyzed:
- **Previous Scene**: How the story left off and where to begin
- **Next Scene**: Where the story is heading and how to conclude this scene
- **Story Elements**: Core narrative foundation and themes
- **Base Context**: Foundational setting and background
- **Characters**: Key character summaries, motivations, and relationships
- **Settings**: Key location details, atmosphere, and story influence

Use these insights to create a scene that flows seamlessly from the previous scene and leads smoothly into the next scene.

## Current Scene to Write
<SCENE_OUTLINE>
{current_scene_summary}
</SCENE_OUTLINE>

## Core Requirements
- **Word Count**: AT LEAST 1000 words (mandatory)
- **Output**: Only the scene content - no commentary, metadata, or summaries
- **Scope**: Stay within the scene outline boundaries - expand creatively but don't add new events

## Writing Guidelines

### What to Include
- Rich sensory details and vivid descriptions
- Natural, character-appropriate dialogue
- Internal thoughts and emotional depth
- Character development and voice consistency
- Smooth transitions and logical flow

### Scene Opening
- Begin by naturally continuing from where the previous scene left off
- Use your understanding of the previous scene to create seamless continuity
- Establish the scene's setting and mood based on what came before

### Scene Development
- Expand the scene outline with creative depth and detail
- Maintain character consistency and voice
- Build tension, emotion, or development as appropriate
- Ensure each moment flows logically to the next
- Advance the chapter's plot or character arcs

### Scene Conclusion
- Use your understanding of the next scene to create a proper transition
- End this scene in a way that naturally leads into what's coming next
- Create anticipation or momentum for the next scene
- Ensure smooth narrative flow between scenes

### What NOT to Include
- Commentary about the writing process
- Meta-text about story structure
- Events beyond the scene outline
- Exposition or spoilers
- Working notes or thought process
- **Direct copying from the understanding context** (use it as guidance, not content)

### Creative Boundaries
- **WITHIN the outline**: Add depth, details, dialogue, and emotional richness
- **BEYOND the outline**: Never add new events, actions, or plot developments
- **Think of it as**: Expanding a skeleton into a full body, but not adding new limbs
- **Understanding context**: Use it like a style guide and continuity reference, not a content source
