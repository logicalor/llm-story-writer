Here is the information about the scene that I want you to write.

It is the final scene for a chapter in a novel.

</SCENE_OUTLINE>

IMPORTANT: The SCENE_OUTLINE is your guide to writing the scene's content.  Do not write anything outside the scope of this outline.

## Core Requirements
- **Word Count**: AT LEAST 1000 words (mandatory)
- **Output**: Only the scene content - no commentary, metadata, or summaries
- **Scope**: Stay within the scene outline boundaries - expand creatively but don't add new events

### What to Include
- Rich sensory details and vivid descriptions
- Natural, character-appropriate dialogue
- Internal thoughts and emotional depth
- Character development and voice consistency
- Smooth transitions and logical flow

### What NOT to Include
- Commentary about the writing process
- Meta-text about story structure
- Events beyond the scene outline
- Exposition or spoilers
- Working notes or thought process
- **Content from the guidance sections above** (story context, chapter outline, story elements, etc.)

### Creative Boundaries
- **WITHIN the outline**: Add depth, details, dialogue, and emotional richness
- **BEYOND the outline**: Never add new events, actions, or plot developments
- **Think of it as**: Expanding a skeleton into a full body, but not adding new limbs
- **Guidance sections**: Use them like a style guide, not a content source

2. Expand creatively on the scene outline
