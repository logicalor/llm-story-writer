Here is the information about the scene that I want you to write.

It is the first scene for a chapter in a novel.

## Core Requirements
- **Word Count**: AT LEAST 1000 words (mandatory)

### What to Include
- Rich sensory details and vivid descriptions
- Natural, character-appropriate dialogue

### Creative Boundaries

- **BEYOND the outline**: Never add new events, actions, or plot developments
- **Think of it as**: Expanding a skeleton into a full body, but not adding new limbs
