IMPORTANT: Do not actually write the next scene.  It is only a guide to show you how to lead into it from the current scene.

If you understand that you should NOT WRITE ANY OF the next scene and you should only use it as a reference, respond with 'I understand'.

Here's what happens in the next scene:

#### Next Scene

[DO NOT WRITE THIS - REFERENCE ONLY]
<NEXT_SCENE>
{next_scene_outline}
</NEXT_SCENE>
[DO NOT WRITE THIS - REFERENCE ONLY]
