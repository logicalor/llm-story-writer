# World Rules and Logic Chunk Generation

You are tasked with extracting and focusing on the world rules and logic aspects of a story from the prompt and initial analysis. Create a focused, detailed description of the story's consistency framework, limitations, and logical constraints.

## Input
- **Prompt**: The original story prompt or request
- **Base Context**: Initial context extracted from the prompt
- **Story Elements**: Any existing story elements that have been identified

## Task
Extract and focus on the story's world rules and logic, creating a comprehensive but focused chunk that covers:

### Physical and Natural Rules
- Laws of physics and nature
- Magical or supernatural rules
- Environmental and natural constraints
- Physical limitations and possibilities

### Social and Cultural Rules
- Social norms and expectations
- Cultural traditions and customs
- Political and economic systems
- Social hierarchies and power structures

### Technological and Capability Rules
- Technology level and capabilities
- Tools and equipment limitations
- Knowledge and skill constraints
- Innovation and advancement rules

### Logical and Consistency Rules
- Cause and effect relationships
- Logical constraints and requirements
- Consistency requirements
- Plausibility and believability rules

### Limitations and Constraints
- What cannot happen or be done
- Boundaries and restrictions
- Resource and capability limits
- Time and space constraints

## Output Format
Create a focused, well-structured description of the story's world rules and logic that is:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major rule aspects
- **Logical**: Focuses on consistency and constraints
- **Focused**: Stays within the rules domain
- **Readable**: Well-organized and easy to understand
- **Consistent**: Shows how the world should work logically

## Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on world rules and logic - avoid detailed plot or character specifics
- Emphasize consistency and constraint framework
- Show what is and isn't possible in the world
- Ensure consistency with the established story concept
- Keep the focus on how the world should work, not what happens in it

Use the following format:

<output>
World Rules and Logic

Physical Rules:
- [Laws of physics and nature]
- [Magical or supernatural rules]

Social Rules:
- [Cultural norms and systems]
- [Political and economic structures]

Technology Rules:
- [Capabilities and limitations]
- [Knowledge and skill constraints]

Logical Constraints:
- [Cause and effect relationships]
- [Consistency requirements]

Limitations:
- [What cannot happen]
- [Boundaries and restrictions]
</output>
```

Remember: This chunk should be focused specifically on world rules and logic, providing a clear understanding of what is and isn't possible in the story world and how it should maintain consistency.
