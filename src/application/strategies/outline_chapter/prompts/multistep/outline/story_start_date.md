## Your Task

From the story prompt provided earlier, provide a suitable story start date.

If no start date is provided, consider the context provided by the story prompt and think of a suitable start date.  Don't use any placeholders for years, months, days.  Just
go with the first real date that you think of, but something sensible (not the 1st January, for example).

Output it as a simple text string in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Do not provide any other commentary or metadata.
