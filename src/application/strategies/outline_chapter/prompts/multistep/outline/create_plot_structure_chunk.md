# Plot Structure Chunk Generation

You are tasked with extracting and focusing on the plot structure aspects of a story from the prompt and initial analysis. Create a focused, detailed description of the story's structure, pacing, and plot framework.

## Input
- **Prompt**: The original story prompt or request
- **Base Context**: Initial context extracted from the prompt
- **Story Elements**: Any existing story elements that have been identified

## Task
Extract and focus on the story's plot structure, creating a comprehensive but focused chunk that covers:

### Overall Story Structure
- Story structure type (3-act, hero's journey, etc.)
- Major structural divisions and acts
- Story beginning, middle, and end framework
- Structural rhythm and pacing

### Major Plot Points and Turning Points
- Key story beats and milestones
- Inciting incident and catalyst
- Major turning points and reversals
- Climax and resolution structure

### Story Pacing and Rhythm
- How the story should flow and progress
- Pacing variations and tempo changes
- Rising and falling action patterns
- Tension and release cycles

### Subplot Framework
- Secondary storylines and their purposes
- How subplots relate to main plot
- Subplot development and resolution
- Subplot integration points

### Plot Development Patterns
- How conflicts should escalate
- Character arc integration with plot
- Setting utilization in plot development
- Plot consistency and logic flow

## Output Format
Create a focused, well-structured description of the story's plot structure that is:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major structural aspects
- **Structural**: Focuses on story framework and organization
- **Focused**: Stays within the plot structure domain
- **Readable**: Well-organized and easy to understand
- **Developmental**: Shows how plot should progress

## Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on plot structure - avoid detailed character or setting specifics
- Emphasize story organization and pacing framework
- Show plot development patterns and flow
- Ensure consistency with the established story concept
- Keep the focus on how the story should be structured, not what happens in detail

Use the following format:

```xml
<output>
Plot Structure

Story Structure:
- [Overall structure type and framework]
- [Major divisions and acts]

Key Plot Points:
- [Inciting incident and major beats]
- [Turning points and reversals]

Pacing and Rhythm:
- [Story flow and progression]
- [Tension and release patterns]

Subplot Framework:
- [Secondary storylines and purposes]
- [Integration with main plot]

Development Patterns:
- [Conflict escalation and resolution]
- [Character and setting integration]
</output>
```

Remember: This chunk should be focused specifically on plot structure, providing a clear understanding of how the story should be organized and how it should progress.
