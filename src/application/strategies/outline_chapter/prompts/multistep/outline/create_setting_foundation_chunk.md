# Setting Foundation Chunk Generation

You are tasked with analyzing the story prompt to identify all mentioned settings and, if necessary, create additional settings to support the story's needs. Focus on building a complete setting foundation that serves the narrative requirements.

## Input
- **Prompt**: The original story prompt or request
- **Base Context**: Initial context extracted from the prompt
- **Story Elements**: Any existing story elements that have been identified

## Task
Your primary objectives are:

### 1. Extract Mentioned Settings
- Identify ALL settings, locations, and environments explicitly mentioned in the prompt
- Extract setting names, descriptions, and any provided details
- Note setting relationships and connections mentioned
- Capture setting rules, constraints, or characteristics stated

### 2. Create Supporting Settings (if needed)
- Analyze what setting types would best support the story
- Identify gaps in the setting roster that could enhance the narrative
- Create additional settings that serve specific story functions:
  - Contrasting or opposing environments
  - Transitional or journey locations
  - Hidden or secret places that advance the plot
  - Cultural or social centers that enrich the world
  - Minor locations that add depth and realism

## Setting Foundation Elements

### Main Setting Roster

- **Setting Functions**: The role each setting plays in the narrative

### Primary Locations and Environments

- Geographic and physical environments
- Key landmarks and important places
- Setting scope and boundaries

### World Rules and Constraints

## Output Format

## Guidelines
- **Extract First**: Start by thoroughly identifying all settings mentioned in the prompt
- **Analyze Gaps**: Determine what setting types would strengthen the story
- **Create Purposefully**: Only add settings that serve clear narrative functions
- **Maintain Balance**: Ensure the setting roster supports the story without overwhelming it
- **Focus on Function**: Emphasize how each setting serves the story's needs
- **Keep Consistent**: Ensure all settings align with the established world concept
- **World-Building**: Focus on world rules and consistency framework
- **Show Constraints**: Highlight setting limitations and opportunities

Remember: This chunk should provide a complete setting foundation that includes both the settings explicitly mentioned in the prompt and any additional settings needed to create a compelling, well-supported world for the narrative.
