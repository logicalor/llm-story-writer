Write a critique from a commercial fiction editor's perspective.

Please critique the following story outline, providing both detailed feedback and a numerical score for each area. Break down your score by the categories below, and briefly justify each category score with specific examples from the outline.

{outline}
</OUTLINE>

As a commercial fiction editor, evaluate the outline based on these criteria:
    - Pacing (15 points): Does the pacing keep readers turning the pages? Are there hooks, momentum, and well-timed reveals throughout?
    - Details (15 points): Are descriptions clear, accessible, and engaging for a broad audience? Do they enhance the story without slowing it down?
    - Flow (15 points): Does the story flow smoothly and read easily? Are transitions seamless and does the narrative maintain energy?
    - Genre (10 points): Does the story deliver what commercial fiction readers expect for its genre? Will it satisfy the target market?
    - Consistency (10 points): Is the story consistent in tone, style, and characterization? Are characters believable and relatable for a wide readership?
    - Character Arcs & Theme (20 points): Are characters engaging and easy to root for? Are themes accessible and resonant without being heavy-handed?
    - Structure (15 points): Is the structure clear, compelling, and satisfying? Does it build to a strong climax and resolution?

For each category, assign a score and provide justification based on commercial fiction standards, referencing specific parts of the outline. The overall score should reflect the sum of all category scores.
