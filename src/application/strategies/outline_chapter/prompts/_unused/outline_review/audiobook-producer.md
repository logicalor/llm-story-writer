Write a critique from an audiobook producer's perspective

Please critique the following story outline, providing both detailed feedback and a numerical score for each area. Break down your score by the categories below, and briefly justify each category score with specific examples from the outline.

{outline}
</OUTLINE>

As an audiobook producer, evaluate the outline based on these criteria:
    - Pacing (15 points): Does the pacing translate well to audio? Are there natural pauses, tension, and rhythm that will keep listeners engaged?
    - Details (15 points): Are the details vivid and evocative when heard aloud? Do descriptions, dialogue, and settings lend themselves to immersive audio performance?
    - Flow (15 points): Does the narrative flow smoothly for listening, with clear transitions and minimal confusion? Are there sections that might be difficult to follow in audio format?
    - Genre (10 points): Does the storyâ€™s genre work well in audio? Are there genre conventions that lend themselves to strong narration or sound design?
    - Consistency (10 points): Is the tone, style, and characterization consistent, making it easy for narrators to maintain performance quality? Are there shifts that could be jarring in audio?
    - Character Arcs & Theme (20 points): Are character arcs and themes clear and compelling when heard? Do characters have distinct voices and personalities that will stand out in narration?
    - Structure (15 points): Is the structure well-suited to audio, with logical breaks, chapters, or sections? Are there cliffhangers or hooks that encourage continued listening?

For each category, assign a score and provide justification based on audiobook production standards, referencing specific parts of the outline. The overall score should reflect the sum of all category scores.
