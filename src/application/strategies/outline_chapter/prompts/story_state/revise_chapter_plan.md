## Guidelines

## Revision Considerations
- What new information has been revealed that affects this chapter?

## Example Output
**Updated Content:** Sarah's investigation now includes her new knowledge about her family's supernatural legacy. She approaches the mystery with more confidence and understanding of her abilities.

**New Events:** Sarah consults with the ghost about her family history, discovers a hidden family journal, uses her enhanced abilities to investigate more effectively

**Character Updates:** Sarah now acts with the confidence she gained in previous chapters and draws on her growing understanding of the supernatural world

**Plot Changes:** The investigation now incorporates the family legacy subplot, making it more personal and raising the stakes

**Revision Reason:** The chapter needs to reflect Sarah's character growth and the new family legacy plot thread that has emerged since the original plan was created.
