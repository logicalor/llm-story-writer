# Progressive Story Generation System

This document describes the new progressive story generation system that allows stories to evolve organically as chapters are written, rather than following a rigid, pre-determined outline.

## Overview

The progressive story generation system transforms the AIStoryWriter from a rigid, upfront planner to a living, breathing story development tool that grows organically with the writer's creative process. Each chapter builds upon and informs the next, creating a more natural and engaging storytelling experience.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Story State Management**
- **Story Context**: Maintains evolving story direction, themes, and world rules
- **Character Evolution**: Tracks character development and growth across chapters
- **Plot Threads**: Manages ongoing plot elements and their evolution
- **Chapter States**: Tracks planned vs. actual chapter content and revisions

### 2. **Progressive Chapter Generation**
- **Chapter-by-Chapter Planning**: Each chapter is planned based on current story state
- **Organic Development**: Characters and plot evolve naturally through the writing process
- **Adaptive Structure**: Story direction can shift based on what emerges during writing
- **Quality Iteration**: Chapters can be revised based on story evolution

### 3. **Progressive Outline Planning**
- **Dynamic Outline Development**: Outline evolves as chapters are written and analyzed
- **Context-Aware Planning**: Each chapter plan considers full story context and evolution
- **Continuous Refinement**: Outline elements are revised based on story development
- **Scalable Structure**: Works with stories of any length without upfront complexity

### 4. **Story Evolution Tracking**
- **RAG-Based Analysis**: Uses retrieval-augmented generation to analyze chapters without reading full content
- **Continuous Analysis**: Each completed chapter is analyzed for its impact on the story
- **State Updates**: Story context, characters, and plot threads are updated automatically
- **Revision Triggers**: Previous chapter plans are revised when necessary
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensures story elements remain coherent as they evolve

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### **StoryStateManager**
The central component that manages the evolving story state:

```python
class StoryStateManager:
    - story_context: StoryContext      # Current story direction and themes
    - characters: Dict[str, CharacterState]  # Character development tracking
    - plot_threads: Dict[str, PlotThread]    # Plot element management
    - chapters: Dict[int, ChapterState]      # Chapter state tracking
    - story_evolution: List[str]             # Evolution log
    - rag_integration: RAGIntegration        # RAG-based story interrogation
```

#### **OutlineGenerator (Enhanced)**
Now supports both traditional and progressive outline approaches:

```python
class OutlineGenerator:
    # Traditional methods
    - generate_outline()              # Generate full outline upfront
    
    # Progressive coordination methods
    - initialize_progressive_outline() # Initialize progressive system
    - plan_next_chapter_progressive()  # Coordinate chapter planning
    - revise_outline_progressive()     # Coordinate outline revision
```

#### **Strategy (Enhanced)**
The strategy now provides progressive story generation:

```python
class OutlineChapterStrategy:
    # Traditional methods
    - generate_outline() + generate_chapters()  # Full upfront generation
    
    # Progressive methods
    - generate_progressive_story()              # Complete progressive generation
    - plan_next_chapter_progressive()           # Manual chapter planning
    - get_progressive_outline_status()          # Get current status
```

#### **RAG-Based Analysis**
The system uses retrieval-augmented generation to analyze story elements:

```python
# Instead of reading entire chapter content:
await story_state_manager.update_story_evolution(chapter_num, settings)

# The system queries RAG about specific aspects:
- Character developments and growth
- Plot advancements and new threads
- Theme exploration and development
- Tension changes and pacing
- World building and rule revelations
```

#### **Architecture Separation**
The progressive system maintains clear separation of concerns:

```python
# OutlineGenerator: Coordinates progressive planning
outline_generator.plan_next_chapter_progressive(settings)

# StoryStateManager: Handles actual planning and state management
story_state_manager.plan_next_chapter(settings)

# ChapterGenerator: Generates chapter content based on plans
chapter_generator.generate_chapter_from_plan(chapter_plan, settings)
```

#### **Data Structures**

- **StoryContext**: Overall story direction, themes, tone, pacing
- **CharacterState**: Individual character development and relationships
- **PlotThread**: Ongoing plot elements and their status
- **ChapterState**: Planned vs. actual chapter content and metadata

### Workflow

```
1. Story Prompt → Initialize Story Context
2. Plan Next Chapter → Generate Chapter Content
3. Analyze Evolution → Update Story State
4. Check Revisions → Revise Previous Plans if Needed
5. Repeat for Next Chapter
```

## Usage

### Basic Progressive Story Generation

```python
from application.strategies.outline_chapter.strategy import OutlineChapterStrategy

# Initialize strategy
strategy = OutlineChapterStrategy(model_provider, config, prompt_loader, savepoint_repo)

# Generate story progressively
chapters = await strategy.generate_progressive_story(prompt, settings)
```

### Manual Story State Management

```python
from application.strategies.outline_chapter.story_state_manager import StoryStateManager

# Initialize story context
story_context = await story_state_manager.initialize_story_context(prompt, settings)

# Plan next chapter
chapter_state = await story_state_manager.plan_next_chapter(settings)

# Update story evolution after writing chapter
await story_state_manager.update_story_evolution(chapter_content, chapter_num, settings)

# Revise chapter plans if needed
await story_state_manager.revise_chapter_plan(chapter_num, settings)
```

## Prompts

The system uses several specialized prompts to guide the progressive generation process:

### 1. **Story Context Initialization** (`story_state/initialize_context.md`)
- Analyzes initial prompt to establish foundational story elements
- Sets direction, themes, tone, audience, and pacing
- Establishes world rules and genre conventions

### 2. **Chapter Planning** (`story_state/plan_next_chapter.md`)
- Plans each chapter based on current story state
- Considers character development and plot evolution
- Allows for organic story growth

### 3. **Evolution Analysis** (`story_state/analyze_evolution.md`)
- Analyzes how completed chapters affect story development
- Tracks character growth, plot advancement, and new themes
- Updates story state based on evolution

### 4. **Chapter Revision** (`story_state/revise_chapter_plan.md`)
- Revises chapter plans based on story evolution
- Ensures consistency with current story state
- Maintains plot coherence

### 5. **Content Generation** (`story_state/generate_chapter_content.md`)
- Generates actual chapter content from planned state
- Maintains consistency with story evolution
- Creates engaging, well-written prose

### 6. **RAG Interrogation** (`story_state/rag_interrogation.md`)
- Provides framework for RAG-based story analysis
- Enables analysis without reading entire chapter content
- Supports scalable story evolution tracking

### 7. **Progressive Outline Coordination**

## Configuration

### Required Models

The progressive system requires these model configurations:

```yaml
models:
  initial_outline_writer: "llama3.1:8b"      # Story context initialization
  chapter_outline_writer: "llama3.1:8b"      # Chapter planning
  logical_model: "llama3.1:8b"              # Evolution analysis
  scene_writer: "llama3.1:8b"                # Content generation
  info_model: "llama3.1:8b"                  # Story metadata
```

### Settings

Key generation settings for progressive stories:

```python
settings = GenerationSettings(
    wanted_chapters=5,           # Target chapter count
    debug=True,                  # Enable debug output
    stream=False,                # Disable streaming for analysis
    seed=42,                     # Random seed for consistency
    log_prompt_inputs=False      # Disable prompt logging
)
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the system:

```bash
python test_progressive_story_generation.py
```

This will test:
- Story State Manager initialization
- Progressive story generation
- Chapter planning and revision
- Story evolution tracking

## Migration from Traditional System

The progressive system is designed to work alongside the existing traditional outline-chapter approach:

### **Traditional Method** (Still Available)
```python
# Generate full outline first
outline = await strategy.generate_outline(prompt, settings)

# Generate all chapters from outline
chapters = await strategy.generate_chapters(outline, settings)
```

### **Progressive Method** (New)
```python
# Generate story progressively
chapters = await strategy.generate_progressive_story(prompt, settings)

# Or manually plan chapters one at a time
chapter_plan = await strategy.plan_next_chapter_progressive(settings)
status = await strategy.get_progressive_outline_status(settings)
```
