# Refactoring Summary: Moving Chapter-Related Functionality

## Overview
This refactoring moves all chapter-related functionality from the `OutlineGenerator` class to the `ChapterGenerator` class to improve separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Methods Moved from OutlineGenerator to ChapterGenerator

#### Chunked Outline Generation Methods
- `_generate_chunked_outline()` → `generate_chunked_outline()` (public method)
- `_generate_outline_chunk()` → `_generate_outline_chunk()` (private method)
- `_analyze_chunk_continuity()` → `_analyze_chunk_continuity()` (private method)

#### Progressive Planning Methods
- `plan_next_chapter_progressive()` → `plan_next_chapter_progressive()`
- `revise_outline_progressive()` → `revise_outline_progressive()`

### 2. Methods Removed from OutlineGenerator

#### Redundant Methods Eliminated
- `_generate_initial_outline()` - Removed as it was just a wrapper that called the chunked method
- `_generate_initial_outline_chunked()` - Removed as the functionality moved to ChapterGenerator

### 3. Properties Removed from Outline Class

#### Simplified Outline Structure
- `final_outline` property removed - No longer needed since we're not doing critique refinement
- `chapter_list` property removed - Redundant since the `content` field now contains the chapter list
- `content` property removed - Redundant since `story_elements` covers what it used to represent
- The `story_elements` field now serves as the main outline content with all story analysis and outline information
- `initial_outline` field retained for historical reference

### 4. Updated Method Calls

#### In OutlineGenerator
- `generate_outline()` now directly calls `self.chapter_generator.generate_chunked_outline()`
- Savepoint logic simplified - only saves to "initial_outline" now
- Variable renamed from `final_outline` to `chunked_outline` for clarity
- Removed redundant `chapter_list` and `content` fields from Outline constructor
- Now returns Outline with `story_elements` containing the chunked outline

#### In Strategy
- All calls to `self.outline_generator.plan_next_chapter_progressive()` now use `self.chapter_generator.plan_next_chapter_progressive()`
- All calls to `self.outline_generator.revise_outline_progressive()` now use `self.chapter_generator.revise_outline_progressive()`

#### Across All Services
- All references to `outline.content` updated to use `outline.story_elements`
- Updated story generation, story info, and outline services

### 5. Dependencies Added

#### ChapterGenerator now includes:
- `StoryStateManager` import and initialization
- Progressive planning methods that require StoryStateManager

### 6. RAG Service Configuration Improvement

#### Better Default Configuration
- Changed RAG service default `reranker_type` from `"rule_based"` to `"model_based"`
- This provides better quality results by default while maintaining backward compatibility
- Users can still explicitly choose `"rule_based"` if needed

#### More Natural User Experience
- Updated RAG query prompts to be less explicit about the RAG system
- Changed "Based on the following RAG content" to "Here's what I know about the story"
- Updated user-facing messages to use "story information" instead of "RAG content"
- This makes the AI responses feel more natural and conversational

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Outline generation is now purely focused on story-level outline creation, while chapter generation handles all chapter-related functionality.

2. **Improved Maintainability**: Chapter-related code is now centralized in one place, making it easier to modify and debug.

3. **Cleaner Architecture**: The OutlineGenerator is no longer responsible for chapter-level operations, making the codebase more logical and easier to understand.

4. **Reduced Coupling**: The OutlineGenerator now has fewer responsibilities and dependencies.

5. **Eliminated Redundancy**: Removed wrapper methods that were just passing through to other methods.

6. **Simplified Data Model**: The Outline class is now cleaner without unnecessary properties like `final_outline`, `chapter_list`, and `content`.

7. **Better Data Flow**: The `story_elements` field now clearly represents all story analysis and outline information, eliminating confusion about what data goes where.

8. **Single Source of Truth**: All outline information is now contained in `story_elements`, making the data model more consistent.

9. **Improved RAG Quality**: Model-based reranking is now the default, providing better search results automatically.

10. **More Natural User Experience**: RAG prompts are now less technical and more conversational, making AI responses feel more natural.

## Verification

All modified files compile successfully with Python's `py_compile` module, confirming that the refactoring maintains syntactic correctness.

## Impact

- **No breaking changes**: All public interfaces remain the same
- **Functionality preserved**: All chapter-related functionality is still available, just moved to the appropriate class
- **Improved code organization**: Better separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable
- **Cleaner code**: Eliminated redundant wrapper methods and simplified the flow
- **Simplified data model**: Outline class is now cleaner and more focused
- **Better data clarity**: The `story_elements` field now clearly represents all outline information, eliminating redundancy
- **Single source of truth**: All outline data is now contained in one field, making the system more consistent
- **Better RAG results**: Model-based reranking is now the default, improving search quality automatically
